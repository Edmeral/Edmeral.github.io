title: Managing environment variables on Node.js

So you have that newly API key set up, that you want to incorporate into your Node.js app, you don't want to hard code it directly into you  application code, because you want to share it later to the world and you don't want everyone using your API key (substitute API key by any sensitive data), in fact there are [bots](http://www.devfactor.net/2014/12/30/2375-amazon-mistake/) crawling GitHub looking for EC2 secret keys on public projects, so they can spawn EC2 servers to mine Bitcoin, you definitely don't want to be like the guy in the article, right?

### Environment variables
One approach to solve this problem, is storing that API key as an environment variable on your system, those are accessible in Node.js  in the object ```process.env``` you'll find things like your username, localization sttuf (go ahead and try it), but how to add them? if you are on Linux (as you should be :smile:), you simply want to add this line your ```.bashrc``` or ```.zshrc```.

```sh
export VARIABLE_NAME=VARIABLE_CONTENT
```

This will do the trick (to be run on your terminal):

```sh
echo export API_KEY=AWESOME_API_KEY >> .bashrc
source .bashrc
```

The first line write the variable at the end of ```bashrc``` and the second one tells the terminal to reload `.bashrc` file (this is usually done you launch terminal the first time)
now you cant access that variable:

```js
console.log(process.env.API_KEY);
// ==> AWESOME_API_KEY
```
But that's really tedious to do, and you end up with a really big ```.bashrc``` file filled with dusty API keys you used a long time ago. What if we could store in a separate file that we can just load at the start of the app?

### dotenv to the rescue
<<<<<<< HEAD
[dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) is a really cool package that allow us to do just that. Here is how it works: you store your environment variable in file called ```.env``` just like we used to do before then you load that file into your app, and ta da you have all your variable available under the object ```process.env``` just like we used to have when stored them on ```.bashrc```. The cool thing is that now you have a separate file per each project and you can pass around this file you deploy you app or need to change some variable.
In the root of your project create a file ```.env```, and don't remember to add it to ```.gitignore``` so we don't push by mistake to a public repo:

```sh
touch .env
echo .env >> .gitignore
```

Install the packege:

```sh
npm install --save dotenv
```
Add content to the `.env`

```
AWESOME_VARIABLE=I'M AWOSEME
FANTASTIC_VARIABLE=I'M FANTASTIC
```

and to use it, add this the begging of your app script:

```js
var dotenv = require('dotenv');
dotenv.load();
```

Now all you variables are available under `process.env`.

Happy coding! :)
