title: "How to create a connected mini weather station using a Raspberry pi and/or an Arduino board"
---

The goal to this tutorial is to create [a simple weather station](http://weather.aissam.me) to check temperature and weather: We will look at how to get the data from a sensor, send it to the cloud, and then retrieve it to display it on a web page, I'll assume you know how to [SSH](FIXME) into a your Raspberry Pi, and the [basics](FIXME!) of working with an Arduino.

> Pretty much everything you need!

Here is what you'll need:

* An Arduino board (an Arduino UNO would be enough)
* A Raspberry Pi.
* DHT11 sensor
* 10K resistor
* Some jumper wires
* Breadboard
* Time
